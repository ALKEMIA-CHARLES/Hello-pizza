### Description

Hello Pizza is an interactive pizza selling platform that caters for orders customers want to post by providing the different varities of Pizza. The project used objects and constructors to set the pizza type/toppings variballes and also included functions that were used to provide the if/else statements that were used to cater the different scenarios the customers would choose.

The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jquery.  HTML was used to work on the organization of the site in term of how the site looked, CSS was used to style it. JavaSript and Jquery were used to referenece the objects and constructors. 

Bugs:
found it diffcilut to likbk delivery link to function that can be called on JS. I instead decided to link everything on JS.
